	//Let's practice calling different methods by writing our very own methods. You will write and save methods in the space below
	//that call the existing methods you see already written here.  Ready?  Let's Go!


	//Sample: Here is a public method that calls the getfavoriteColorsMethod below and prints the results to our debug log
	public static void printOutFavoriteColorsDemo () {
		List < String > favoriteColors = getFavoriteColors();
		system.debug('Here are the favorite colors: '+ favoriteColors);
	}


	//1.  Write a public method that calls the getFavoriteColors method to get a list of favorite colors, then add 
	//another color to the list before printing it to the debug log. 
	//(see the sample above for an example of calling that method-You can even start by copying and pasting that method here, renaming and modifying it)
    public static void printFavouriteColoursNow() {
        
        // call the getFavoriteColors method and assign that methods values to the new list variable we create
   		List < String > favouriteColoursNow = getFavoriteColors();    
        
        // add a new colour to the new list variable
        favouriteColoursNow.add('Teal');
        
        // Print the new list to the debug log
        System.debug('These are the colours plus my sneaky colour ' + favouriteColoursNow);
    }
