	//Assignment:  The following method is supposed to create the number of accounts specified in the argument that it takes.
	//Each Account should be named 'Sample Account #sampleNumber'  where sample number is the count.  So if you created 2 Accounts
	//one would be called 'Sample Account 1' and the other 'Sample Account 2'

	//Also, when we're done inserting them, we will create a case for each one with a Status of 'New', Origin of 'New Account' and the
	//desription and subject of your choice.  

	//This isn't working quite right.  Can you use your debugging skills to fix it?  I had to comment it out since it won't compile
	//Look out for consistency and formatting too!  (even if they don't break the code)
	//Add comments to describe what the code is doing.
	//After you get it to compile, run it in execute anonymous and check that it's really working!  Look up your new accounts in your org!

    	// create a method that takes an integer (not a decimal) as a parameter? argument,..?
	public static void createSampleAccounts (integer numberOfAccounts) {

        // create a list to hold the accounts to insert
		List < Account > acctList = new List < Account >();

		for (Integer i = 1; i <= numberOfAccounts; i++) {
			Account a	= new Account();
			a.Name 		= 'Sample Account ' + i;
		}
		// insert the records using a DML statement
		insert acctList;

        // Create a list to hold the cases to insert
		List < Case > casesToInsert = new List < Case >();

        // Loop through the list of accounts we created to add a new case to each
		for (Account a: acctList) {
            
            // make a counter for the sole purpose of incrementing on the case subject
            // declare and initialise an integer variable because I can't refer to the other integer as it's in
            // the for loop
      integer i = 1;
            
            // create a new case and assign values to the fields
