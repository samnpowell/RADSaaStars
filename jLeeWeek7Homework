	//Assignment:  The following method is supposed to create the number of accounts specified in the argument that it takes.
	//Each Account should be named 'Sample Account #sampleNumber'  where sample number is the count.  So if you created 2 Accounts
	//one would be called 'Sample Account 1' and the other 'Sample Account 2'

	//Also, when we're done inserting them, we will create a case for each one with a Status of 'New', Origin of 'New Account' and the
	//desription and subject of your choice.  

	//This isn't working quite right.  Can you use your debugging skills to fix it?  I had to comment it out since it won't compile
	//Look out for consistency and formatting too!  (even if they don't break the code)
	//Add comments to describe what the code is doing.
	//After you get it to compile, run it in execute anonymous and check that it's really working!  Look up your new accounts in your org!

	public static void createSampleAccounts (integer numberOfAccounts) {
		//List to hold accounts
		List < Account > acctList = new List < Account >();
        
            //As long as i is less than the number of Accounts, it will increment the value by 1. 
            //Create an account where the name is Sample Name x, where x is the integer
            //Add the new account to the AcctList
            for (Integer i = 0; i <= numberOfAccounts; i++) {
                Account a = new Account();
                a.Name = 'Sample Account ' +i;
                acctList.add(a);
                //print the counter value
                system.debug('What is the value of i at this moment?: '+i); 
                //print the account name, which should be Sample Name x
                system.debug('Account Name:' +a);
            
		}
        //creates the new accounts
        insert acctList;
        
        //Holds a list of cases that we will insert later
		List < Case > casesToInsert = new List < Case >();

        //First we loop through the acctList, create a new case for each account.
        for (Account a: AcctList) {

			c.Origin = 'New Account';

			c.Description = 'Follow Up on this case please';
			//Add the case to the casesToInsert list
            casesToInsert.add(c);
        	//Print the case information:     
			System.debug('Case Info: ' +c);

        //Create the cases in the database
        // Not sure you need the UPSERT here, as there shouldnt be any old records to update rather than insert on this
